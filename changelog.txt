In this week, I have created the first page of my web app which will display the levels in the forms of buttons.
I also have collected some of the images required for my app and have included the license details.
In addition to this, I have made the directory structure of my project ready.
Furthermore, I have downloaded and included the font that I will be using.
I have achieved all of the milestones I wanted to achieve so far except for the fact that I wanted to collect more game images.

So far, the data required for Shallow level has been collected and proper license has been included.
Furthermore, button for selecting each level has been created.
Once the level button is clicked, the categories in it can be viewed in form of button.
In addition to this, for Shallow category the basic UI for each category has been designed using table.
I believe I have obtained my target outcome to some extent; however, I still have to improve the UI significantly.

Date: April 19, 2018

The use of table has been now replaced by divisions.
Food Chain category is now having images which are clickable; but, the actual logic of increasing the score and making the image pair unhidden once a pair is matched is still not working correctly.
It was frustrating to get the logic working. I have tried to trace the error in my logic by making use of the console outputs. I am positive about resolving this issue very soon.

The logic of increasing score and making the images unhidden once the correct pair is clicked in sequence has been successfully implemented for Food Chain category in Shallow Level.
Though late and with tremendous effort, I have got the game logic working now. This basically means I will be able to build on this logic now onwards.

Date: April 26, 2018

The Food Chain category is working completely as per plan. The idea has now been extended to Professional Tools category in the same level.
Separate java script file is created for each categories and levels.
The data is now stored in separate directory.
I have achieved the target outcome at this point. However, I am a little worried about having enough time to add extra features like animations and sounds to my game.

Date: April 29, 2018

All the image data required for Flag category has been created and stored along with corresponding licensing details.
The game logic has been implemented to these images and now Flag category is also working.
I was actually planning to have finished one level by today; but, it looks like I did not plan out my categories very well. Doing the planning now is consuming some of my time.

Date: May 02, 2018

All the three categories under Shallow level is now working fine. Separate screen to be appeared once the target score in a category is achieved has been created along with some animations.
As of now, the game has one complete level.
Although a little late, I have achieve my target. I will have to pace up my development now to be able to incorporate all the features that I want in my app.

Date: May 04, 2018

Images for all the three category of Deep level has been collected and the corresponding license.txt file and data directory has been updated.
I believe I am doing alright here. Things could have been more paced up had I collected all the data at the beginning of the development.

Date: May 07, 2018

The game logic has been extended to all the three categories of the Deep level. Now, the game has two complete levels.
I am on track now. I have completed two levels and hopefully will complete another one very soon.

Date: May 09, 2018

The image data for all the three categories of the Profound level has been collected and corresponding data file and license file has been updated.
Deciding the categories and images took longer than I had expected. This means I will have to increase the development pace for this level.

Date: May 11, 2018

The game logic has been extended to all the three categories of the Profound level. Now, the game has three complete levels.
Feels good to have completed all the three categories. However, I still have to improve my styles and codes. Also, I want to add some more features.

Date: May 13, 2018

All the categories in all three levels of the game are now provided with an exit option.
A separate menu has been created for each category in all levels which also includes option for information about the category being played.
I have now started adding the extra features, making my app more dynamic. I am also working on improving the styles.

Date: May 14, 2018

The game now has improved UI which adjusts according to device orientation and size.
The styles have been updated to adjust dynamically. This was very crucial milestone that I wanted to achieve.

Date: May 15, 2018

Setting and about us pages have been added to the game now.
My game now has a professional feel to it with these added new features.

Date: May 16, 2018

The game code is now improved with proper comments and audio has been added in the game.
I believe most of the milestones has been achieved in my app. I now have a complete game for children.
And, surprisingly, I have been able to add one more level named as math with three more categories under it.

Date: May 17, 2018

I have recorded my video and improved the resolution.
I have also updated my readme.txt file.
I am now ready to submit my work for evaluation.
